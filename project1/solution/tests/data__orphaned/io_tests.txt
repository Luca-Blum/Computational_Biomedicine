The "genome_correct.txt" file used in the tests is generated by tests\data\io\fasta_test.py.
The .test files are generated using fastq_test.py. The last file is too big to store on GitHub therefore is uploaded to https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/YnStdV7msmTjP8q .
I did not write the fastq code and feel not good enough to make modifications, so I don't.
